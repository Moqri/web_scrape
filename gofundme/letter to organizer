Dear Rex,
My name is Mahdi Moqri and I'm a research scholar in Information Systems (http://www.moqri.com). I'm studying  online fundraising platforms to improve their efficiency. I was wondering if I can ask you a few short questions about the factors contributing to the success of your fundraising campaign. My research is intended to help nonprofits like yours in their online fundraising campaigns. 
I'm looking forward to hearing back from you
Best,
Mahdi Moqri
